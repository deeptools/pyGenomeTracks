Welcome to pyGenomeTracks's documentation!
==========================================

Standalone program and library to plot beautiful genome browser tracks
----------------------------------------------------------------------

pyGenomeTracks aims to produce high-quality genome browser tracks that
are highly customizable. Currently, it is possible to plot:

- bigwig
- bed/gtf (many options)
- bedgraph
- epilogos
- narrow peaks
- links
- Hi-C matrices

pyGenomeTracks can make plots with or without Hi-C data. The following is an example output of
pyGenomeTracks from `Ram√≠rez et al. 2017 <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02525-w>`_.

There are 3 ways for using pyGenomeTracks:

* **Galaxy usage** --  the public `European Galaxy server <http://usegalaxy.eu>`_ let's you use pyGenomeTracks within the familiar Galaxy framework without the need to master the command line
* **command line usage** -- simply download and install the tool (see :doc:`content/installation` and :doc:`content/usage`)
