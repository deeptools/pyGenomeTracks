3.4
===

Improved documentation:

- fix url of test_data thanks to @sonnynguyen
- Better documentation for pyGenomeTracks / makeTracksFile
- Documentation of each track

Enhancements:

- Different bed files format (BED3, BED4, BED5, BED6, BED8, BED9, BED12) is guessed based on the first line and rely not only on number of columns but on the type of each column (string/float etc.). This way, broadPeaks/gappedPeaks and other bed-like formats can be accepted as `file_type = bed` without preprocessing.
- gtf has now its own `file_type`. **Warning**:`file_type = bed` for gtf will be no longer supported in a future version.
- You can use a decreasing x-axis (from larger coordinates to smaller coordinates) with the option `--decreasingXAxis` in `pyGenomeTracks`.
- For bedgraph and bigwig:
  - logScale: To apply a log transformation to your data you can set `transform` to `log1p`, `log`, `log2`, `log10`, `-log`. For others than `log1p`, you can set a `log_pseudocount`. By default the y axis values will represent the transformed values and the transformation will be written on the left of the y axis but you can decide to keep the original values by setting `y_axis_values = original`.
  - operation on files: You can plot the result of an operation on one or two files without preprocessing. To use it, put the operation in `operation` with the variable `file` or both variables `file` and `second_file`, for example `operation = 0.89 * file` or `operation = max(file, second_file)` or `operation = file - second_file`. In the two later cases, you need to put the path of the second file in `second_file`. However, this operation can be time consuming if you do it multiple times and you may prefer to convert your files in advance.

- Both `type = line` and `type = lines` are working in bedgraph_matrix

Bugfix:

- In version 3.3, if you were using a colormap in bed the `border_color` and `color_utr` were ignored. Now each one can be set to different color/colormap/bed_rgb.
