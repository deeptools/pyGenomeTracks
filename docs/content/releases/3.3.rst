3.3
===

Release 3.3 adds:

- a documentation on readthedocs: https://pygenometracks.readthedocs.io
- progress bar for bed, gtf, bedgraph, narrowPeak, epilogos
- all colors can be set as `(r, g, b)` with r, g, b values between 0 and 1.
- all colormap can be set as an array of colors, for example  `[red, white, (0, 0, 0.5)]`
- the titles on the right can be align left, right or center with the argument `--trackLabelHAlign`
- for the links track, 
  - `compact_arcs_level` to be able to see both very long arcs and very small arcs.
  - `ylim` to be able to zoom and see small arcs.
- a new track type: `file_type = scalebar` which by default is close to the UCSC scale bar.
- for the bed tracks:
  - a new gene type: `tssarrow`
  - `border_color` and `color_utr` can be set to `bed_rgb`.
  - `all_labels_inside` allow to put the name of the region on the left if it ends after the plotted region.
  - `labels_in_margin` allow to put the name of the region in the margin if it ends after the plotted region.
- `line_width` can now be set in the narrowPeak tracks.
- `colormap` can now be set in bedgraphMatrix tracks.

bug fixes:
- if a bed with no interval is provided, pgt no longer exit.
- When an exon had both UTR start and UTR end within it, only the UTR start was considered.
- alpha in links tracks was not used
- qcat files with missing values are now working.
