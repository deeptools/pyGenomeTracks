3.3
===

Release 3.3 adds:

- a documentation on readthedocs: https://pygenometracks.readthedocs.io
- progress bar for bed, gtf, bedgraph, narrowPeak, epilogos
- all colors can be set as ``(r, g, b)`` with r, g, b values between 0 and 1.
- all colormap can be set as an array of colors, for example  ``[red, white, (0, 0, 0.5)]``
- the titles on the right can be align left, right or center with the argument ``--trackLabelHAlign``
- for the links track, 
   - ``compact_arcs_level`` to be able to see both very long arcs and very small arcs.
   - ``ylim`` to be able to zoom and see small arcs.
- a new track type: ``file_type = scalebar`` which by default is close to the UCSC scale bar.
- for the bed tracks:
   - a new gene type: ``tssarrow``
   - ``border_color`` and ``color_utr`` can be set to ``bed_rgb``.
   - ``all_labels_inside`` allow to put the name of the region on the left if it ends after the plotted region.
   - ``labels_in_margin`` allow to put the name of the region in the margin if it ends after the plotted region.
- ``line_width`` can now be set in the narrowPeak tracks.
- ``colormap`` can now be set in bedgraphMatrix tracks.

bug fixes:

- if a bed with no interval is provided, pgt no longer exit.
- When an exon had both UTR start and UTR end within it, only the UTR start was considered.
- alpha in links tracks was not used
- qcat files with missing values are now working.
