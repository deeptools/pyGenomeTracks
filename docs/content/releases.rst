Main changes in configuration files:
Since v3.2: 

- there is no more space in the name of the parameters (``line width`` become ``line_width``)
- all on/off, yes/no, 0/1 become true/false

Since v3.4:

- gtf has its own file_type (``file_type = gtf``).

**Warning** in version 4.0 the old configuration files will not work anymore
