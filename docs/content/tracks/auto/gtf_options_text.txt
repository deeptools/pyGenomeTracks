# By default the transcript_name is used.

# exons may give unexpected output especially when

# You can change the color of coding sequences by:

# optional: line_width

# the display parameter defines how the gtf file is plotted.
# Default is 'stacked' where regions are plotted on different lines so
# we can see all regions and all labels.
# The other options are ['collapsed', 'interleaved', 'triangles', 'squares', 'deletions']
# These 2 last options assume that the regions do not overlap:
# `collapsed`: The gtf regions are plotted one after the other in one line.

# if you use UCSC or exonarrows style, you can set the relative distance between 2 arrows on introns/exons
# default is 2
#arrow_interval = 2
# you can also choose the color of arrows
# default is black

# if you use tssarrow style, you can choose the length of the arrow in bp

# if you use flybase, tssarrow or exonarrows style, you can choose the color of non-coding intervals:
#color_utr = grey
# for flybase and tssarrow, you can choose the proportion between their height and the one of coding
# (by default they are the same height):
#height_utr = 1
# if you use flybase or UCSC style, you can choose the color of the backbone
#color_backbone = red
# By default, for oriented intervals in flybase style,
# the arrowhead is added
# outside of the interval.
# If you want that the tip of the arrow correspond to
# the extremity of the interval use:
#arrowhead_included = true
# By default the size of this arrow is 0.4% of the plotted region.
# This size is also used to put space between the gtf regions and
# their labels.
# To increase it:
#arrowhead_fraction = 0.01
# for exonarrows, you can choose the proportion between the height of the introns and the one of exon
# (by default introns are half):
#height_intron = 0.5
# The two following display options are really different and no label can be display:
# `triangles` display each region as a triangle, can be useful to overlay with a hic_matrix
# `squares` display each region as a square along the diagonal, can be useful to overlay with a hic_matrix_square
# The last display option do not expect overlapping feature:
# `deletions` display a line on the plotted region (color can be controlled by color_backbone)
# and a V shape breaking the line for each region in bed (color can be controled by color)
# Labels can be displayed on bottom centered on the region
# optional. If not given is guessed from the file ending.
