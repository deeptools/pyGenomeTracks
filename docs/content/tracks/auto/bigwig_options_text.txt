# To log transform your data you can also use transform and log_pseudocount:
# For the transform values:
# 'log1p': transformed_values = log(1 + initial_values)
# 'log': transformed_values = log(log_pseudocount + initial_values)
# 'log2': transformed_values = log2(log_pseudocount + initial_values)
# 'log10': transformed_values = log10(log_pseudocount + initial_values)
# '-log': transformed_values = - log(log_pseudocount + initial_values)
# For example:
#tranform = log
#log_pseudocount = 2
# When a transformation is applied, by default the y axis
# gives the transformed values, if you prefer to see
# the original values:
#y_axis_values = original
