# To use transparency, you can use alpha

# to convert missing data (NaNs) into zeros. Otherwise, missing data is not plotted.

# for type, the options are: line, points, fill. Default is fill
# to add the preferred line width or point size use:
# type = line:lw where lw (linewidth) is float
# similarly points:ms sets the point size (markersize (ms) to the given float
# type = line:0.5
# type = points:0.5
# If you want to plot a 4C track where you want to link
# the non-missing data (NaNs) together and only use the
# middle of the region instead of the region itself:
# Default is false.
# use_middle = true
# By default the bedgraph is plotted at the base pair
# resolution. This can lead to very large pdf/svg files
# If plotting large regions.
# If you want to decrase the size of your file.
# You can either rasterize the bedgraph profile by using:
# rasterize = true
# Or use a summary method on a given number of bin:
# The possible summary methods are given by pyBigWig:
# mean/average/stdev/dev/max/min/cov/coverage/sum
# summary_method = mean
# number_of_bins = 700
# set show_data_range to false to hide the text on the left showing the data range
show_data_range = true
# to compute operations on the fly on the file
# or between 2 bedgraph files
# operation will be evaluated, it should contains file or
# file and second_file,
# we advice to use nans_to_zeros = true to avoid unexpected nan values
#operation = 0.89 * file
#operation = - file
#operation = file - second_file
#operation = log2((1 + file) / (1 + second_file))
#operation = max(file, second_file)
#second_file = path for the second file
# To log transform your data you can also use transform and log_pseudocount:
# For the transform values:
# 'log1p': transformed_values = log(1 + initial_values)
# 'log': transformed_values = log(log_pseudocount + initial_values)
# 'log2': transformed_values = log2(log_pseudocount + initial_values)
# 'log10': transformed_values = log10(log_pseudocount + initial_values)
# '-log': transformed_values = log(log_pseudocount + initial_values)
# For example:
#tranform = log
#log_pseudocount = 2
# When a transformation is applied, by default the y axis
# gives the transformed values, if you prefer to see
# the original values:
#y_axis_values = original
