# The score field is optional

#   chr1 100 200 chr1 250 300 0.5
# depending on the value of links_type either 'arcs' or 'triangles' or 'loops'
# or 'squares' can be plotted.
# If arcs, an arc will be drawn linking the beginning of the first region (chr1: 100),
# to the end of the other region (chr1: 300) except if use_middle is set to true.
# If triangles, the vertix of the triangle will be drawn at the center between the two points
# (also the extremity of each position is used)
# If loops, a diamond highlighting the intersection between the 2 regions will be shown
# the triangles, and loops options are convenient to overlay over a
# Hi-C matrix to highlight the matrix pixel of the highlighted link.
# If squares, a rectangle highlighting the intersection between the 2 regions will be shown
# In this case the y axis represent region2 which can be specified
# By default it is the same as the region of the x-axis

#max_value = 1.2
# To use transparency, you can use alpha
# default is 0.8
# alpha = 0.5
# if line_width is not given, the score is used to set the line width
# using the following formula (0.5 * square root(score)
#line_width = 0.5

# 1 (the height is proportional to the square root of the distance)
# 2 (the height is the same for all distances)

# To be able to see small arcs when big arcs exists, you can set
# the upper y limit.
# The unit is bp. This corresponds to the longest arc you will see.
